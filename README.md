Detailed Explanation of File Permissions:

File permissions in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux or macOS) are critical for ensuring that only authorized users can read, write, or execute files. These permissions govern who can perform actions on a file and are divided into three categories:
1. Owner: The user who created the file.
2. Group: A set of users who share the same file permissions.
3. Others: All other users who are neither the owner nor part of the group.
Each file has three types of permissions:
- Read (r): Allows the user to view the contents of the file.
  Write (w): Allows the user to modify or delete the file.
- Execute (x): Allows the user to run the file if it's a script or program.
 Permissions Representation:
The permissions for a file are typically displayed as a 10-character string like this:
-rwxr-xr--
Breaking it down:
1. First character: Represents the file type.
   - - means it's a regular file.
   - d means it's a directory.
2. Next three characters (Owner Permissions): 
   - r for read, w for write, and x for execute. For example, rwx means the owner can read, write, and execute the file.
3. Next three characters (Group Permissions): 
   - The same symbols (r, w, x) for the group. For example, r-x means the group can read and execute the file, but not modify it.
4. Last three characters (Other Permissions):
   - These represent the permissions for all other users. For example, r-- means others can only read the file.

 Understanding File Permission Breakdown:
- Owner Permissions: These are the permissions for the file's creator (the owner).
  - If the owner has read permission (r), they can open and view the contents of the file.
  - If the owner has write permission (w), they can modify or delete the file.
  - If the owner has execute permission (x), they can run the file if it's executable, like a script.

- Group Permissions: These are the permissions for users who belong to the same group as the file. The group is defined when the file is created or modified.
  - Read: Allows members of the group to view the contents.
  - Write: Allows group members to modify or delete the file.
  - Execute: Allows group members to execute the file, if applicable.

- Other Permissions: These apply to all users who do not own the file and are not part of the file's group.
  - Read: Allows others to view the file.
  - Write: Allows others to modify or delete the file.
  - Execute: Allows others to execute the file, if itâ€™s an executable file.
